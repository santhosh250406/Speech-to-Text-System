# **Speech-to-Text Recognition System**  
This repository contains the implementation of a **speech-to-text recognition system** developed during my internship at **Cothon Solutions**. The project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to convert spoken language into accurate textual representations.  

## üöÄ **Project Overview**  
The goal of this project is to create a robust speech-to-text recognition system using state-of-the-art deep learning models and audio signal processing techniques.  

### **Key Features**:  
- Accurate transcription of audio files using **Wav2Vec 2.0** pre-trained models.  
- Advanced **audio feature extraction** with **Librosa** for signal processing.  
- Performance evaluation with **Word Error Rate (WER)** for model assessment.

## üí° **Technologies Used**  
- **Speech Recognition**: Wav2Vec 2.0 (Hugging Face Transformers)  
- **Deep Learning Framework**: PyTorch  
- **Audio Processing**: Librosa  
- **Dataset**: LibriSpeech test-clean dataset  
- **Evaluation Metric**: Word Error Rate (WER)  

---

## ü§ñ **Future Enhancements**  
- Fine-tune the Wav2Vec 2.0 model on domain-specific datasets.  
- Add noise reduction techniques for improved transcription accuracy in noisy environments.  
- Extend support for additional languages and dialects.
